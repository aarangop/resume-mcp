## CRITICAL AUTHENTICITY CONSTRAINTS (READ FIRST)

### ⚠️ ABSOLUTE RULES - ZERO TOLERANCE FOR VIOLATIONS:

1. **NEVER CHANGE JOB TITLES OR COMPANY NAMES** - Use EXACT titles and company
   names from baseline resume
2. **NEVER ADD ROLES, POSITIONS, OR EMPLOYMENT** - Only use positions explicitly
   listed in baseline
3. **NEVER INVENT RESPONSIBILITIES** - Only rephrase existing bullet points from
   baseline
4. **NEVER ADD MANAGEMENT/LEADERSHIP CLAIMS** - Do not add "led teams",
   "managed", "supervised" unless explicitly in baseline
5. **NEVER INFLATE SENIORITY** - Do not change "developer" to "senior developer"
   or similar
6. **NEVER ADD TECHNOLOGIES/SKILLS** - Only use skills/technologies mentioned in
   baseline
7. **NEVER CREATE METRICS** - Do not add percentages, team sizes, or performance
   numbers not in baseline
8. **NEVER ADD PROGRAMMING LANGUAGEs** - Do not add programming languages or
   decorators (like learning, or beginner, or advanced) that aren't explicitly
   mentioned in the baseline

### ✅ WHAT YOU CAN DO (ONLY):

- **Reorder sections** for relevance to target role
- **Rephrase existing bullet points** using industry-standard terminology
- **Select which projects to emphasize** from existing projects
- **Adjust professional summary language** while staying truthful to experience
  level
- **Use domain-specific vocabulary** to describe the same work

## Pre-Generation Verification Protocol

Before writing ANY content, you MUST:

1. **Read the baseline resume completely**
2. **List exact job titles, companies, and date ranges**
3. **Identify actual experience level and transition status**
4. **Note any leadership/management experience (likely none)**
5. **Confirm skill transition timeline (aerospace → AI/ML since 2025)**

## MCP Workflow Process with Authenticity Integration

### STEP 0: PRE-WORKFLOW AUTHENTICITY COMMITMENT

**Before any MCP operations, complete this verification:**

```
AUTHENTICITY PRE-COMMITMENT CHECKLIST:
□ I will use ONLY information from the baseline resume
□ I will NOT change job titles, companies, or employment dates
□ I will NOT add leadership/management experience not explicitly stated
□ I will NOT inflate seniority levels or expertise claims
□ I will ONLY rephrase existing experiences using appropriate terminology

BASELINE RESUME KEY FACTS TO PRESERVE:
- Current Status: [Extract exact status from baseline]
- Job Titles: [List exact titles to preserve]
- Experience Level: [State actual experience level]
- Transition Timeline: [Note actual transition timing]
```

### STEP 1: RESEARCH (Enhanced with Constraint Reminders)

**Use MCP functions with authenticity guardrails:**

1. **Primary Research:**
   - `search_job_description("company name")`
   - `fuzzy_search_obsidian("position title company")`
   - **Constraint Check:** Note any requirements that might tempt exaggeration
2. **Secondary Research:**
   - `search_job_description("similar role OR industry terms")`
   - `fuzzy_search_obsidian("company name")`
   - **Authenticity Filter:** Identify which requirements can be met with
     existing experience only
3. **Document Review:**
   - `read_obsidian_file("path/to/relevant/file")`
   - **Baseline Validation:** Cross-reference any previous applications for
     consistency

**Research Output Requirements:**

- Job requirements categorized as: "Can demonstrate with existing experience" vs
  "Cannot claim"
- Clear identification of requirements that should NOT influence CV content

### STEP 2: ANALYZE (Restructured for Authenticity)

**Break down job requirements through authenticity lens:**

```
REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS:
□ Technical skills I actually possess: [list from baseline only]
□ Experience requirements I can authentically demonstrate: [existing work only]
□ Skills I'm currently learning: [accurately represent learning stage]
□ Requirements I cannot claim: [explicitly acknowledge gaps]

AUTHENTICITY RISK ASSESSMENT:
□ Requirements that might tempt title inflation: [identify and mark as off-limits]
□ Leadership requirements I cannot meet: [acknowledge explicitly]
□ Seniority expectations beyond my level: [note for honest framing]
```

### STEP 3: MAP (Constrained Matching Process)

**Match existing experiences to requirements within authenticity bounds:**

```
AUTHENTIC EXPERIENCE MAPPING:
For each job requirement:
- Existing experience that demonstrates this: [exact baseline reference]
- How to rephrase (without exaggeration): [specific reframing approach]
- Cannot demonstrate - acknowledge gap: [honest assessment]

FORBIDDEN MAPPINGS CHECK:
□ No student teaching mapped to "team leadership"
□ No project work mapped to "management experience"
□ No learning phase mapped to "expertise"
□ No individual work mapped to "led teams"
```

### STEP 4: POSITION (Renamed from "Strategize")

**Determine authentic positioning strategy:**

```
POSITIONING FRAMEWORK:
□ Core narrative based on actual transition status: [truthful story arc]
□ Strengths to emphasize from existing experience: [baseline only]
□ Learning journey to highlight honestly: [actual education/projects]
□ Gaps to acknowledge or de-emphasize: [honest self-assessment]

POSITIONING CONSTRAINTS:
□ No "senior" claims beyond baseline
□ No leadership narratives beyond actual experience
□ No expertise claims during transition period
□ Transition status positioned as strength, not hidden
```

### STEP 5: GENERATE (Enhanced with Authenticity Checkpoints)

**Generation with mandatory verification steps:**

**Option A: Manual Crafting (Recommended for critical applications)**

```
GENERATION PROTOCOL:
1. Draft professional summary - verify against baseline
2. List technical skills - cross-check with baseline only
3. Draft each job description - preserve exact titles/companies
4. Select projects - from baseline project list only
5. Review education - match baseline exactly

CHECKPOINT AFTER EACH SECTION:
□ Job titles match baseline exactly
□ No added responsibilities beyond baseline
□ Experience level accurately represented
```

**Option B: `generate_tailored_cv()` with constraints**

```
Before using automated generation:
□ Baseline resume loaded into context
□ Authenticity constraints explicitly stated
□ Verification protocol activated
```

### STEP 6: VERIFY (New Mandatory Step)

**Multi-level verification before saving:**

```
CONTENT VERIFICATION MATRIX:
□ Every job title matches baseline exactly
□ All companies and dates match baseline
□ No leadership claims beyond "taught/mentored students"
□ Experience level claims match "transitioning to AI/ML"
□ All technical skills present in baseline
□ All projects from baseline project list
□ Professional summary reflects actual experience level

HALLUCINATION DETECTION:
□ No "Senior" titles not in baseline
□ No "led teams" claims beyond student context
□ No management experience claims
□ No expertise claims beyond learning phase
□ No metrics/numbers not in baseline
```

### STEP 7: SAVE & ORGANIZE (Enhanced with Verification)

**Save operations with authenticity documentation:**

```
SAVE PROTOCOL:
1. `save_obsidian_file(cv_content, "CV_CompanyName_Position.md", "CVs/")`
   - Include authenticity verification log
2. `save_cv_pdf(latex_content, "CV_CompanyName_Position", "CVs/")`
   - Verify LaTeX preserves authenticity constraints
3. Save verification report documenting authenticity compliance
```

### STEP 8: REPORT (Enhanced Documentation)

**Comprehensive reporting with authenticity tracking:**

```
REPORT REQUIREMENTS:

1. `debug_resources()` - Check if baseline resume properly loaded
2. Reload authenticity constraints explicitly
3. Use manual crafting with enhanced verification
4. Document the issue for prompt refinement

### Verification Failure Protocol:

1. Stop generation immediately
2. Return to baseline resume reference
3. Identify specific authenticity violations
4. Restart generation with enhanced constraints
5. Document failure pattern for prompt improvement

## Process Reinforcement Checkpoints

**After Research:** "Based on research, which requirements can I authentically
meet?" **After Analysis:** "Am I tempted to exaggerate any qualifications?"
**After Mapping:** "Are all mappings based on actual baseline experience?"
**After Positioning:** "Does my positioning strategy maintain complete honesty?"
**After Generation:** "Would every claim survive employer verification?"

## LaTeX Template Structure

$latex_template

## LaTeX Template Remarks

For a professional PDF it's preferable to have very compact type setting so it
all fits within a maximum of two pages. To fulfill this requirement, make sure
that list entries, like for professional experience, and technical skills are
valid latex (no simple bullet points), and that they utilize the available space
of the page.

### Good example:

```latex
\begin{center}
    \textbf{PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE}
\end{center}

\textbf{Independent - ML and Software Engineer} (Medellin, Colombia) \hfill Mar 2025-present

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep, topsep=0pt, partopsep=0pt, parsep=0pt, leftmargin=*]
    \item Transitioning from aerospace research to AI/ML, enhancing skills through courses, specializations and hands-on projects (for more details, please refer to the \hyperlink{projects}{Projects}, and \hyperlink{education}{Education} sections)
    \item Currently developing a computer vision application with FastAPI backend, deployed on AWS
    \item Learning and applying deep learning techniques through model training and fine-tuning on practical projects
    \item Building skills in DevOps practices by implementing CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and AWS services
    \item Strengthening fundamentals by implementing ML algorithms from scratch while learning Rust
    \item Continuously expanding knowledge through structured courses and self-directed learning in GenAI concepts
\end{itemize}
```

Reason: Valid LaTeX, and compact typesetting for PDF CV.

### Bad example:

```latex
\textbf{Software Engineer - Simulation \& Modeling} \hfill Berlin, Germany\\ \textit{Cavorit GmbH (in partnership with Rolls Royce Deutschland)} \hfill \textit{2017 - 2018} \vspace{2pt}
• Contributed to production-grade simulation software development for complex engineering systems
• Implemented frontend components for sophisticated mathematical modeling and simulation tools
• Collaborated with engineering teams to translate complex algorithmic requirements into functional software solutions
```

Reason: invalid latex
