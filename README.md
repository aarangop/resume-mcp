   ```

3. Install the MCP Inspector (for debugging/development):
   ```bash

   ```

## üîß Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables (or
configure them in your environment):

```env
# Server configuration
SERVER_NAME="Resume Tailoring Server"

# File paths
BASELINE_RESUME_PATH="./templates/baseline_resume.md"
PROMPT_TEMPLATE_PATH="./templates/prompt_template.md"
LATEX_TEMPLATE_PATH="./templates/latex_template.tex"
OUTPUT_DIRECTORY="./templates/tailored_resumes"

# Obsidian vault configuration (optional)

# LaTeX configuration
LATEX_COMPILER="pdflatex"  # or xelatex, lualatex
LATEX_OUTPUT_DIR="./templates/latex_output"

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL="INFO"

# Anthropic API key (if using Anthropic models)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_anthropic_api_key"
```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Server

### Standard Mode

To run the server in standard mode:

```bash
python main.py
```

The server will start in stdio transport mode, which allows it to be connected
to any MCP-compatible client.

### With Inspector (Development/Debug Mode)

For development and testing, you can run the server with the MCP Inspector:

```bash
# Using the provided script
./inspect.sh

# Or manually
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv --directory /Users/andresap/repos/resume-mcp run main.py
```

### Debugging Issues

If you're experiencing server problems, you can run the debug script:

```bash
python debug_server.py
```

This will perform various checks on your setup and help identify any issues.

placeholders like `$name`.

## üìö Example Workflow

1. Set up your baseline resume in `templates/baseline_resume.md`
2. Configure your LaTeX template in `templates/latex_template.tex`
3. Run the server: `python main.py`
4. Connect with an MCP client (such as an integrated LLM)
5. Submit a job description to the "Tailor CV" prompt
6. Generate a LaTeX/PDF version using the CV tools
7. Review and use your tailored resume!

## üîç Troubleshooting

### LaTeX Template Issues

If you see warnings about missing placeholders in your LaTeX template, check
that it includes all required fields like `$name`.

### Initialization Problems

If you encounter
`RuntimeError: Received request before initialization was complete`, try:

1. Adding a small delay after importing components
2. Using the debug server to identify issues
3. Make sure all imports are properly structured

### MCP Connection Issues

If clients cannot connect to the server:

1. Check that stdio transport is working correctly
2. Verify that all required components are imported
3. Run with the inspector for detailed logs
